Data replication or database replication: means copy the data to each or multiple hosts/server present inside the network.

Merits of data replication:
1: Reduces the latency : since the data is present a each server or host so accessing data takes lesser time.
2: Helps in backing up (recovery) od data.
3: scalability: since data is present on mutiple servers so it can handle high workload.
4: fault tolerance : if one server fails another can handle.
