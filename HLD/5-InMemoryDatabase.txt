In-Memory database:- It is a type of database in which the data is stored in the RAM of the system ,instead of storing it in 
                      hard disk. 

Merits: 
1: Low latency: since the data is stored in RAM so it can be frequently accessed.
    (note: latency is the time between request and response)

2: High Throughput
    (note: throughput is basically the number of read and write operation performed over a period of time)   

3: Highly scalable database

4: Provides Caching functionality to retrieve data faster.

Demerits:
1: Data persistence: Data do not persist after power faliure.
